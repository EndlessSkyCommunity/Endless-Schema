# Endless Schema

## What is Endless Schema?
This project aims to create an open, standard specification for the structure of JSON data in the data files of Endless Sky.

## Does Endless Sky use JSON for data files?
Not at this time. It is hoped that once all the data Endless Sky uses is described, then the engine and files can be converted to use JSON instead of the current data format. This will make it easier to validate and manipulate game data, as well as help accelerate develpoment of custom tools like Endless Sky Mission Builder.
